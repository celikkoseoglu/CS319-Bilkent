# OtoParker 
Project Description:
  OtoParker is a classical car parking game with extended in-game options. The game will start with the top view of your car in a parking area with a selected lot for you to park in. The aim of the user is to park their car in a parking slot using the controller keys without crashing other cars or obstacles. In the higher levels, users will face with more challenging obstacles and harder maps (?parkours).  As users gain experience (?coins) by playing, they will be able to unlock higher levels and can update their car modals, and also they will able to modify their cars with weapons to destroy the obstacles.
